I made this project to work on my programming skills. Working with databases, HTTP requests and logic. Also mocking of security tokens generated by SimCompanies.
This script ran about 80 companies at the same time. It could build and upgrade buildings, buy and sell on the market, send contracts and most importantly finish and claim achievements. It used a database table to store information on all companies including randomly generated email adresses and passwords. My script can generate unlimited amounts of accounts with use of proxies. Please don't do that. I analysed the gameplay and optimised my script so that one company could send the parent around $500k worth of construction units within about 24 hours. This movement is highly unusual and will be detected by the developers of SimCompanies. If you adapt the price close to market there is no real profit available. Therefore is this script a great way to be banned fast. Nothing else. 

With this I would like to demonstrate my programming abilities and not to cause harm in any way. I am not liable if someone uses a clone of this script. IT IS INTENDED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

NOTE: DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT AS IT IS AGAINST SIMCOMPANIES TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THE USE WILL RESULT IN A PERMANENT DELETION OF YOUR ACCOUNT.
